## General

The goal of this project is to reproduce the famous "Pixel War" of Reddit. This part is the front-end of the project. The project was done during my second year at Epitech to earn some "xp".

## Technical

I used ReactJS from the official documentation. The previous "experience-react" allowed me to better realize this project.


## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Sn00ww/pixel-war
```

## Usage

```sh
npm i
npm run start
```
